# Key Concepts to Learn in Vault

## 1. Vault Basics
Understanding the core concepts and functionality of HashiCorp Vault.

### Learn about:
- **What is Vault?**: A tool for securely storing and accessing secrets.
- **Secrets**: Any kind of sensitive information like passwords, tokens, API keys.
- **Vault Server**: The central Vault service that manages secrets.
- **Vault Clients**: Applications or users interacting with Vault.

## 2. Vault Authentication Methods
Understand how Vault authenticates users and applications.

### Learn about:
- **Auth Methods**: How users/apps authenticate with Vault (e.g., AppRole, LDAP, AWS IAM).
- **Token Authentication**: Vault's default authentication method.
- **AppRole**: Authentication method for machines and services.
- **LDAP/Active Directory Authentication**: Integrate with existing identity providers.

## 3. Vault Policies
Control access to secrets using policies.

### Learn about:
- **ACL Policies**: Access Control List policies to control who can read/write secrets.
- **Policy Language**: HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) used to define policies.
- **Policy Rules**: Define paths and operations users are allowed to perform.

## 4. Vault Secrets Engines
Learn how Vault stores and manages secrets.

### Learn about:
- **Key/Value Secrets Engine**: Store arbitrary secrets in a key-value store.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generate secrets on the fly (e.g., database credentials).
- **Database Secrets Engine**: Dynamically generate database credentials.
- **AWS Secrets Engine**: Manage AWS IAM credentials and access policies.
- **PKI Secrets Engine**: Issue and manage X.509 certificates.

## 5. Vault Tokens and Leases
Understanding how tokens and secret leases work.

### Learn about:
- **Tokens**: Vault issues tokens after authentication to access secrets.
- **Token Lifetime**: Tokens can have a limited TTL (time-to-live).
- **Leases**: Secrets in Vault can have leases, meaning they expire after a set time.
- **Renewing Tokens/Leases**: Automatically renew tokens and leases before they expire.

## 6. Vault Encryption as a Service (EaaS)
Vault can be used for encryption as a service.

### Learn about:
- **Transit Secrets Engine**: Perform encryption/decryption without storing the data.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt data in transit, without storing it in Vault.
- **HMAC**: Hash-based message authentication code to verify data integrity.
- **Data Key Generation**: Generate cryptographic keys for encryption.

## 7. Vault High Availability (HA)
Understanding how to deploy Vault in a highly available manner.

### Learn about:
- **HA Architecture**: Vault can be set up in an active/passive configuration.
- **Raft Storage Backend**: A consensus algorithm to manage leader election and replication.
- **Consul Backend**: Use Consul as the storage backend for high availability.
- **Auto Unseal**: Automatically unseal Vault using cloud KMS services (e.g., AWS, Azure).

## 8. Vault Unsealing and Shamir’s Secret Sharing
How Vault protects the master key and how to unseal Vault.

### Learn about:
- **Sealed vs. Unsealed**: Vault starts in a sealed state and needs unsealing to function.
- **Shamir’s Secret Sharing**: Split the master key into multiple shares.
- **Unseal Keys**: Multiple unseal keys are needed to unseal Vault.
- **Auto Unseal**: Automate unsealing using external services like AWS KMS.

## 9. Vault Audit Logs
Monitoring and auditing Vault activities.

### Learn about:
- **Audit Devices**: Vault can log operations to audit devices (e.g., syslog, file).
- **Audit Logs**: Store and review logs for monitoring and compliance.
- **Filtering Logs**: Configure what information gets logged.
- **Audit Backend**: Determine where the logs are written (file, socket, etc.).

## 10. Secrets Lifecycle Management
Understanding how to manage the lifecycle of secrets.

### Learn about:
- **Secret Versioning**: Manage multiple versions of secrets.
- **Secret Rotation**: Regularly rotate secrets (e.g., database passwords).
- **Revocation**: Revoke secrets and tokens to immediately deny access.
- **Dynamic Secrets Rotation**: Automatically rotate dynamic secrets after use.

## 11. Vault Integration with Kubernetes
Integrating Vault with Kubernetes for secret management.

### Learn about:
- **Kubernetes Auth Method**: Authenticate Kubernetes workloads to Vault.
- **Injecting Secrets into Pods**: Use Vault to inject secrets directly into Kubernetes pods.
- **Vault Agent**: Run a Vault agent to automatically authenticate and inject secrets.
- **Kubernetes Secrets Engine**: Manage Kubernetes service accounts and access policies.

## 12. Vault Namespaces (Enterprise)
Understand how Vault supports multi-tenancy.

### Learn about:
- **Namespaces**: Isolate tenants or teams within a single Vault instance.
- **Managing Namespaces**: Create and manage namespaces for different teams.
- **Scoped Resources**: Limit policies, secrets, and roles to specific namespaces.

## 13. Vault Best Practices
Developing best practices for managing Vault in production.

### Learn about:
- **Secret Leasing & TTLs**: Ensure all secrets have appropriate TTLs and leases.
- **Rotation Policies**: Regularly rotate secrets and tokens.
- **Minimal Access Policies**: Follow the principle of least privilege for Vault policies.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Continuously monitor Vault activity with audit logs.

## 14. Vault Plugins and Extensions
Extending Vault’s functionality with plugins.

### Learn about:
- **Secrets Engine Plugins**: Extend Vault with custom secret engines.
- **Auth Method Plugins**: Add custom authentication methods.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Understand how plugins are written and managed in Vault.
- **Third-party Integrations**: Leverage community or vendor-provided plugins for additional functionality.

## 15. Vault Disaster Recovery and Backup
Preparing for failure scenarios in Vault.

### Learn about:
- **Backup Strategies**: Implement a backup strategy for Vault data.
- **Disaster Recovery Mode**: Deploy Vault in disaster recovery mode for failover.
- **Replication**: Use Vault’s replication features to ensure data availability.
- **Recovery Keys**: Safeguard unseal and root tokens for disaster recovery.

## 16. Vault Enterprise Features
Explore enterprise-specific features in Vault.

### Learn about:
- **Performance Replication**: Replicate data across regions for high performance.
- **DR Replication**: Set up disaster recovery replication for Vault.
- **Namespaces**: Use namespaces for better multi-tenancy.
- **Control Groups**: Implement workflows that require multiple users for approval.
