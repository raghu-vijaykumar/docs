# Key Concepts to Learn in Kubernetes

## 1. Kubernetes Architecture
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform with a master-slave architecture.

### Learn about:
- **Master components**: API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd
- **Worker components**: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, container runtime
- **Cluster architecture**: Nodes, Pods, and Services

## 2. Pods
A pod is the smallest, most basic deployable object in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process.

### Learn about:
- Pod lifecycle and states
- Multi-container pods (sidecar containers)
- Pod communication (localhost in a pod)
- Health checks: liveness and readiness probes

## 3. Deployments
Deployments ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running at all times.

### Learn about:
- Creating and managing deployments
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Scaling deployments (horizontal pod autoscaling)
- Self-healing and monitoring deployment health

## 4. Services
Services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names to Pods, abstracting away the underlying pod instances.

### Learn about:
- Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName)
- Service discovery within the cluster
- External access to services (Ingress, LoadBalancers)
- Headless services for stateful workloads

## 5. ConfigMaps and Secrets
ConfigMaps and Secrets are used to inject configuration data and sensitive information into containers.

### Learn about:
- Using ConfigMaps to store environment configurations
- Using Secrets to manage sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Mounting ConfigMaps and Secrets as volumes or environment variables

## 6. Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) provide persistent storage to Kubernetes pods.

### Learn about:
- PV and PVC lifecycle
- Dynamic provisioning of storage
- Storage classes for different types of storage
- Volume types (hostPath, NFS, cloud storage)

## 7. Namespaces
Namespaces are used to isolate different environments and groups of resources within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Learn about:
- Creating and managing namespaces
- Resource quotas and limits per namespace
- Namespace-level network policies
- Multi-tenancy using namespaces

## 8. Networking
Kubernetes uses a flat network model to allow communication between pods across nodes.

### Learn about:
- Pod networking (CNI plugins like Calico, Flannel)
- ClusterIP and NodePort services
- Network policies for controlling traffic between pods
- Service discovery (DNS) in Kubernetes

## 9. Ingress
Ingress provides external access to services within the Kubernetes cluster, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.

### Learn about:
- Ingress controllers (NGINX, Traefik)
- Configuring Ingress rules for path-based and host-based routing
- TLS termination and securing traffic with Ingress
- Load balancing using Ingress

## 10. StatefulSets
StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications that require stable and persistent storage.

### Learn about:
- StatefulSets vs Deployments
- Stable pod identifiers and persistent storage
- StatefulSet scaling and rolling updates
- Managing databases and distributed systems with StatefulSets

## 11. DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a pod runs on all or selected nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Learn about:
- Use cases for DaemonSets (log collection, monitoring)
- Updating DaemonSets
- Rolling updates for DaemonSets
- Managing system-level workloads with DaemonSets

## 12. Jobs and CronJobs
Jobs and CronJobs are used for running batch and scheduled tasks.

### Learn about:
- One-time jobs vs CronJobs
- Configuring retries and backoff limits
- Running periodic tasks with CronJobs
- Handling long-running jobs and timeouts

## 13. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
HPA automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization.

### Learn about:
- Setting up HPA based on CPU/memory usage
- Custom metrics for autoscaling (Prometheus, custom adapters)
- Thresholds and targets for scaling
- Autoscaling policies and cool-down periods

## 14. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is used to manage permissions and access control in Kubernetes clusters.

### Learn about:
- Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles, and ClusterRoleBindings
- Scopes of roles (namespace vs cluster-wide)
- Controlling access to resources
- Best practices for managing permissions

## 15. Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging are critical for understanding the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

### Learn about:
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Visualizing metrics with Grafana
- Logging with Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack)
- Health checks and alerts

## 16. Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of applications.

### Learn about:
- Creating and managing Helm charts
- Deploying applications using Helm
- Helm repositories and chart versions
- Using Helm to manage complex Kubernetes applications

## 17. Kubernetes Security
Security in Kubernetes is essential to protect your workloads from external threats.

### Learn about:
- Pod security policies and admission controllers
- Securing sensitive data with Secrets
- Network policies for restricting traffic
- Securing communication with TLS and certificates

## 18. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
CRDs allow you to define your own resources in Kubernetes.

### Learn about:
- Creating and managing CRDs
- Custom controllers and operators
- Use cases for extending Kubernetes functionality with CRDs
- Writing custom logic for resource management

## 19. Kubernetes Operators
Operators are applications that extend Kubernetes capabilities by managing complex workloads.

### Learn about:
- Writing custom operators
- Operator lifecycle management
- Use cases for Kubernetes Operators
- Automating the management of stateful applications with operators

## 20. Service Mesh
A service mesh provides traffic management, observability, and security features for microservices.

### Learn about:
- Using Istio or Linkerd as service meshes
- Traffic routing, load balancing, and failover in a service mesh
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) and securing service-to-service communication
- Monitoring service communication with distributed tracing (Jaeger)

## 21. Kubernetes in Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Environments
Kubernetes can be deployed across multiple clouds and on-premise infrastructure.

### Learn about:
- Multi-cluster management (KubeFed, Cluster API)
- Running Kubernetes in hybrid environments (on-prem and cloud)
- Federated Kubernetes clusters for workload distribution
- Networking challenges in multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments

## 22. Kubernetes Ecosystem Tools
Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of tools for various tasks like debugging, networking, and observability.

### Learn about:
- Telepresence for debugging
- Kubectl plugins for command-line extensions
- Istio, Calico, Cilium for networking
- Tools like K9s, Kubeapps for managing Kubernetes environments
