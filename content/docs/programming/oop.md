# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects can contain both data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and methods (functions) that operate on the data. The primary concepts in OOP are:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, or object, and restricting access to certain components of the object. This protects the internal state of an object from unwanted interference.

- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. This allows for simpler interfaces to interact with the object without needing to know the underlying complexity.

- **Inheritance**: Creating a new class (subclass) based on an existing class (superclass), inheriting its attributes and methods, but also having the ability to override or add new functionality. This allows for code reuse and a hierarchical relationship between classes.

- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It typically manifests in two ways:

  - **Method Overloading**: Methods in the same class having the same name but different parameters.
  - **Method Overriding**: A subclass providing a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

These principles make OOP a powerful model for designing modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.
