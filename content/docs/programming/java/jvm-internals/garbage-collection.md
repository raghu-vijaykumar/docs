# Garbage Collection in Java

Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is a process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use by the program. This helps in managing memory efficiently and avoiding memory leaks. This document covers the basics of GC, its types, and how it works in Java.

## 1. What is Garbage Collection?

Garbage Collection is a mechanism for automatic memory management in Java. It identifies and discards objects that are no longer reachable from the application, freeing up memory for new objects.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1. Heap Memory

The Java heap is where all the class instances and arrays are allocated. The heap is divided into two main regions:
- **Young Generation**: Where new objects are allocated. It is further divided into the Eden Space and two Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1).
- **Old Generation (Tenured Generation)**: Where objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation are moved.

### 2.2. Generational Garbage Collection

Javaâ€™s GC is generational, meaning it divides objects into generations based on their age:
- **Young Generation**: Contains short-lived objects. GC events in this space are frequent and are referred to as Minor GC.
- **Old Generation**: Contains long-lived objects. GC events in this space are less frequent and are known as Major GC or Full GC.

### 2.3. GC Algorithms

Different GC algorithms are employed to optimize the collection process:
- **Mark and Sweep**: Identifies live objects (mark phase) and then sweeps away the dead objects (sweep phase).
- **Mark and Compact**: Similar to Mark and Sweep but also compacts the remaining objects to reduce fragmentation.
- **Copying**: Used in the Young Generation. Objects are copied from the Eden Space to one of the Survivor Spaces, and the other Survivor Space is used to store objects that survive.

## 3. Garbage Collection Process

### 3.1. Minor GC

- **Trigger**: Occurs when the Young Generation space is full.
- **Process**: Collects and removes objects from the Eden Space and moves surviving objects to a Survivor Space or Old Generation if they persist.
- **Impact**: Usually has a short pause time but happens frequently.

### 3.2. Major GC (Full GC)

- **Trigger**: Occurs when the Old Generation space is full or when a Minor GC cannot reclaim enough space.
- **Process**: Involves collecting both the Young and Old Generations. It includes marking and sweeping all objects, including those in the Old Generation.
- **Impact**: Can be more time-consuming and may cause longer pause times.

## 4. Garbage Collection Algorithms and Collectors

### 4.1. Serial GC

- **Description**: Uses a single thread for garbage collection.
- **Suitable for**: Small applications with low latency requirements.
- **Flag**: `-XX:+UseSerialGC`

### 4.2. Parallel GC (Throughput Collector)

- **Description**: Uses multiple threads for garbage collection to improve throughput.
- **Suitable for**: Applications with high throughput requirements.
- **Flag**: `-XX:+UseParallelGC`

### 4.3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) GC

- **Description**: Minimizes pause times by performing most of the GC work concurrently with the application threads.
- **Suitable for**: Applications requiring low latency.
- **Flag**: `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`

### 4.4. G1 (Garbage-First) GC

- **Description**: Aims to provide high throughput and low pause times by dividing the heap into regions and performing incremental collections.
- **Suitable for**: Applications with large heaps and mixed requirements for throughput and pause times.
- **Flag**: `-XX:+UseG1GC`

## 5. GC Tuning

### 5.1. Heap Size

- **Initial Heap Size**: `-Xms` (e.g., `-Xms512m`)
- **Maximum Heap Size**: `-Xmx` (e.g., `-Xmx4g`)

### 5.2. Young Generation Size

- **Size of the Young Generation**: `-Xmn` (e.g., `-Xmn1g`)

### 5.3. GC Logging

- **Enable GC Logging**: `-Xloggc:<file>` (e.g., `-Xloggc:gc.log`)
- **Log GC Details**: `-XX:+PrintGCDetails` and `-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps`

## 6. Best Practices

- **Monitor and Analyze**: Regularly monitor GC logs and analyze them to understand the behavior and performance.
- **Tune Parameters**: Adjust heap sizes and GC algorithms based on application requirements and behavior.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Focus on optimizing GC settings after identifying performance issues related to garbage collection.

## 7. Conclusion

Garbage Collection is a vital aspect of memory management in Java, and understanding its mechanisms helps in optimizing application performance and responsiveness. By choosing the right GC algorithm and tuning parameters appropriately, developers can ensure efficient memory usage and minimize the impact of garbage collection on application performance.
