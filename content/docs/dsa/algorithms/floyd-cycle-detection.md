# Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm, is a two-pointer algorithm used to detect cycles in a sequence or a linked list. It was developed by Robert W. Floyd and is one of the most efficient algorithms for determining whether a cycle exists in a linked list or any other structure that behaves similarly to a linked list (e.g., a sequence of numbers generated by a function).

## How It Works
The algorithm uses two pointers, referred to as the "tortoise" and the "hare":

- Tortoise: This pointer moves one step at a time.
- Hare: This pointer moves two steps at a time.

Starting at the same position (typically the head of the linked list or the start of the sequence), both pointers traverse the structure. If there is a cycle, the hare will eventually "lap" the tortoise by entering the cycle and catching up with it. If there is no cycle, the hare will reach the end of the structure (null in the case of a linked list).

## Code and Explanation
Here’s a basic implementation of Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm in a singly linked list.

```java
class ListNode {
    int value;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class CycleDetection {
    
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false; // Empty list or single node with no cycle
        }

        // Initialize two pointers, the slow (tortoise) and fast (hare)
        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head;

        // Traverse the linked list with both pointers
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;        // Tortoise moves one step
            hare = hare.next.next;           // Hare moves two steps

            // If the tortoise and hare meet, there's a cycle
            if (tortoise == hare) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        // If we reach here, there's no cycle in the list
        return false;
    }
}
```
## Explanation of Code
- **Initialization**: We start with two pointers, tortoise and hare, both pointing to the head of the list.
- **Traversal**: In the loop, tortoise moves one step while hare moves two steps. If at any point they meet, this indicates the presence of a cycle.
- **Exit Condition**: If hare or hare.next becomes null, then the list ends without a cycle, and the algorithm returns false.
## Space and Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. In the worst-case scenario (cycle detection), both pointers traverse the list at most n steps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the algorithm only uses two pointers and does not require any extra space for arrays or hash maps.

## When Do We Use It?
Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is used when we need to:

- Detect if a cycle exists in a singly linked list.
- Detect cycles in number sequences generated by functions.
- Detect cycles in algorithms related to graph theory.

## Advantages
- **Efficient**: The algorithm runs in linear time (O(n)) and only requires constant space (O(1)).
- **Simple Implementation**: The use of two pointers makes it easy to understand and implement.

## Disadvantages
- **Only Detection**: This algorithm only detects the presence of a cycle. If you need to find the length of the cycle or the starting node of the cycle, additional steps are required.
- **Assumes a Cycle Exists**: In cases where cycles are extremely rare, the algorithm might not be necessary, and simpler approaches like traversing to the end might suffice.
