## Design Content Moderation System

### Problem Statement
Design a scalable content moderation system that automatically detects and handles inappropriate content across user-generated platforms. The system must process massive volumes of text, images, and videos in real-time, apply ML models for content classification, and support human-in-the-loop workflows while maintaining high accuracy and low false positive rates.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Multi-modal content analysis (text, images, videos, audio)
- Real-time content scoring and flagging
- Machine learning-based classification for abusive content
- Human review workflows for borderline cases
- Community reporting and feedback integration
- Content policy enforcement and customization

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High throughput for content processing (10k+ items/sec)
- Low-latency response (<500ms) for user-facing moderation
- Scalable to billions of content items daily
- High accuracy (>95%) with configurable thresholds
- Fault tolerance with graceful degradation

### Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Scale assumptions**: 10B content items/day processed, 1B active users generating content, peak processing during viral events ^[Assumption: Scale comparable to major social and content platforms.]
- **SLA**: 99.9% availability, p95 processing latency <1s, >99% uptime for core moderation services
- **Content Types**: Text, images, videos, live streams, and user-generated media with global language support
- **Accuracy Balance**: Detect harmful content while minimizing false positives that could censor legitimate speech

### High-Level Design
The system employs a distributed processing pipeline with ML models running on specialized hardware. Content flows through automated scoring, human review queues, and enforcement actions. A feedback loop continuously improves model accuracy based on human corrections.

### Data Model
- **Content Items**: Metadata-rich storage with content hashes, processing timestamps, and moderation history
- **ML Models**: Versioned models with feature extractors, classifiers, and performance metrics
- **Review Queues**: Priority-queued work items for human moderators with SLA tracking
- **Moderation Actions**: Audit trails of all moderation decisions with reasoning and timestamps

### API Design
Webhook and REST APIs for platform integration:

- **POST /api/v1/content/moderate** - Submit content for moderation: `{"content_id": "c123", "type": "text", "content": "text here", "metadata": {...}}` → `{"decision": "allow", "score": 0.15, "flags": []}`
- **GET /api/v1/moderation/queue?priority=high** - Get review items for moderators: Paginated queue with content and context
- **POST /api/v1/moderation/review** - Submit human review: `{"content_id": "c123", "decision": "block", "reason": "hate_speech", "severity": "high"}` → queue update and enforcement
- **PUT /api/v1/policies/{policyId}** - Update moderation rules: `{"rules": [...], "thresholds": {...}}` → rule deployment
- **GET /api/v1/analytics/moderation** - Get moderation metrics: Detection rates, false positives, queue performance

^[APIs use API keys for platform authentication and support webhook callbacks for asynchronous results.]

### Detailed Design
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Specialized pipelines for text (NLP), images (CNN), videos (temporal analysis), with unified scoring
- **ML Model Ensemble**: Multiple models for different abuse types (hate speech, violence, adult content) with confidence scoring
- **Automated Actions**: Rule-based enforcement for high-confidence classifications, queue for medium-confidence
- **Human Workflows**: Ergonomic dashboard for moderators with batch review, collaborative decision-making, and quality control
- **Distributed Processing**: Stream processing for real-time analysis, batch processing for offline model training
- **Edge Computing**: Content pre-processing at user devices to reduce bandwidth and server load
- **Feedback Integration**: Active learning from human corrections to improve model accuracy over time

### Scalability & Bottlenecks
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless processing pipelines scale with content volume, model serving auto-scales per GPU availability
- **Data Partitioning**: Content sharded by creation time, models replicated globally for low-latency serving
- **Queue Optimization**: Priority queues ensure critical content reviewed first, load balancing across moderator pools
- **Resource Management**: GPU/TPU acceleration for ML inference, cache optimization for frequent model queries
- **Bottlenecks**: Human review queue depth; mitigated by automated thresholds and moderator auto-scaling

### Trade-offs & Alternatives
- **Automation vs Human Review**: Full automation scales better vs. human review more accurate for edge cases
- **Real-time vs Batch Processing**: Real-time enables instant feedback vs. batch processing more accurate but slower
- **Centralized vs Decentralized**: Centralized moderation consistent vs. decentralized allows community standards
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Complex models higher accuracy vs. simple rules lower false positives at speed

### Future Improvements
- Generative AI for content summarization and automated responses
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model improvement
- Cross-platform content fingerprinting and tracking
- Real-time trend analysis for proactive moderation
- Voice and audio content moderation capabilities

### Interview Talking Points
1. Explain multi-modal processing: Separate pipelines for text/images/video allow specialization vs. unified approach simpler
2. Discuss ensemble modeling: Multiple ML models vote on content reduces individual model biases vs. single model easier ops
3. Address real-time processing: Streaming architecture enables instant moderation vs. batch processing too slow for live content
4. Compare automated vs human: Automation scales to billions vs. human review needed for nuanced decisions
5. Handle scale: Distributed processing pipelines handle global content volume vs. centralized processing easier consistency
6. Implement feedback loop: Human corrections continuously improve models vs. no feedback models become stale
7. Manage queue depth: Priority scoring ensures toxic content reviewed first vs. FIFO simpler but may miss critical items
8. Balance accuracy/speed: Threshold tuning trades off false positives vs. moderation speed for user experience
