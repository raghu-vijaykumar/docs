# Model Performance Monitoring and Retraining System

## Problem Statement

Design a scalable MLOps system that continuously monitors machine learning model performance in production, detects performance degradation, and automatically triggers retraining pipelines when necessary. The system must handle multiple models, diverse metrics, and integrate seamlessly with existing ML infrastructure while minimizing manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Model Performance Monitoring**: Track prediction accuracy, latency, throughput, and custom business metrics in real-time
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify performance degradation using statistical methods and ML-based thresholds
- **Automated Retraining**: Trigger model retraining when performance drops below acceptable thresholds
- **Alerting System**: Send notifications to data scientists and engineers when issues are detected
- **Historical Analysis**: Maintain performance history and trends for analysis and reporting
- **Multi-Model Support**: Handle multiple models with different monitoring requirements
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with model serving systems, feature stores, and data pipelines

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency**: Real-time monitoring with <1 second prediction tracking and <5 minutes for performance analysis
- **Scalability**: Support 100K+ predictions per second across distributed model serving infrastructure
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failure recovery and data durability
- **Data Retention**: Store performance data for 90 days with aggregated metrics for 1 year
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive model outputs and restrict access based on roles

## Key Constraints & Assumptions

### Assumptions
- **Data Volume**: Handling 100K predictions/second with 10KB average payload size (~1TB daily data)
- **Model Types**: Support for classification, regression, and recommendation models
- **Trigger Thresholds**: Performance acceptable if accuracy drops <5% from baseline within 24-hour window
- **Retraining Frequency**: Maximum retraining frequency of once per day per model to avoid thrashing
- **Label Accuracy**: Ground truth labels available within 24-72 hours for supervised learning models
- **Infrastructure**: Running on Kubernetes with access to cloud storage and compute resources

### Constraints
- **Label Delay**: Ground truth labels may be delayed up to 72 hours, requiring delayed evaluation
- **Cold Start**: New models need baseline establishment period of 24 hours before monitoring
- **Resource Limits**: Retraining jobs limited to 10 concurrent executions across all models

## High-Level Design

### Architecture Overview
The system consists of four main components: Data Collection, Performance Analysis, Decision Engine, and Orchestration. Data flows from model serving systems through monitoring agents, gets analyzed for performance drift, and triggers automated retraining when degradation is detected.

## Detailed Design

### Core Components and Technology Choices

#### 1. Data Collection Layer
- **Technology**: Apache Kafka with custom monitoring agents
- **Why**: Handles high-throughput prediction streams with durability guarantees
- **Architecture**: Distributed collectors deploy alongside model serving infrastructure
- **Scaling**: Topic partitioning by model_id for horizontal scaling

#### 2. Performance Analysis Engine
- **Technology**: Apache Spark Structured Streaming with custom ML libraries
- **Why**: Efficient processing of time-series data with statistical analysis capabilities
- **Key Features**:
  - Sliding window aggregations for real-time metrics
  - Statistical anomaly detection using Z-score and percentiles
  - ML-based drift detection using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

#### 3. Decision Engine
- **Technology**: Rules Engine (Drools) with custom scoring logic
- **Why**: Flexible evaluation of complex business rules for retraining decisions
- **Logic**: Combines multiple signals (performance drop, drift score, business impact)

#### 4. Retraining Orchestration
- **Technology**: Apache Airflow with Kubernetes executor
- **Why**: Workflow management with dependency resolution and failure handling
- **Pipeline**: Automated data pipeline → feature engineering → model training → validation → deployment

### Algorithmic Details

#### Anomaly Detection Algorithm
```java
public class AnomalyDetector {
    private final Double baseline;
    private final Double threshold;
    private final EWMAStats ewmaStats;

    public AnomalyResult detectAnomaly(List<Double> recentValues) {
        Double currentAvg = recentValues.stream()
            .mapToDouble(v -> v).average().orElse(0.0);

        Double zScore = (currentAvg - baseline) / ewmaStats.getStdDev();

        boolean isAnomaly = Math.abs(zScore) > threshold;

        return new AnomalyResult(isAnomaly, zScore, currentAvg);
    }
}
```

#### Drift Detection Process
1. Compare feature distributions between training and serving data
2. Calculate PSI (Population Stability Index) for each feature
3. Monitor prediction distribution shifts
4. Trigger retraining if drift exceeds threshold

## Scalability & Bottlenecks

### Scalability Strategies

#### Horizontal Scaling
- **Data Collection**: Kafka consumer groups auto-scale based on partition lag
- **Analysis Engine**: Spark executors scale with data volume
- **Storage**: Time-series database with partitioning and clustering

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Sampling**: Statistical sampling for high-volume models (1% sample rate)
- **Aggregation**: Pre-aggregated metrics at multiple granularities (1min, 1h, 1day)
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed baseline metrics

### Identified Bottlenecks

#### Storage Hotspots
- **Prediction Table**: High write volume during peak traffic
- **Mitigation**: Partition by time and implement TTL-based cleanup

#### Memory Pressure
- **Real-time Windows**: Maintaining state for sliding window analytics
- **Mitigation**: Spill to disk for large windows, use approximate algorithms

#### Network I/O
- **Data Transfer**: Moving large datasets for retraining
- **Mitigation**: Incremental training, feature store integration

## Trade-offs & Alternatives

### Monitoring Granularity vs. Cost
- **Trade-off**: Fine-grained monitoring (per-prediction) vs. aggregated monitoring
- **Decision**: Aggregated approach with configurable sampling rates
- **Alternative**: Real-time monitoring for critical models only

### Automated vs. Manual Retraining
- **Trade-off**: Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop validation
- **Decision**: Semi-automated with approval workflows for production deployment
- **Rationale**: Prevents cascading failures from faulty retraining

### Batch vs. Streaming Analysis
- **Trade-off**: Accuracy of batch analysis vs. latency of streaming
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach - streaming for alerts, batch for detailed analysis
- **Alternative**: Pure streaming with approximated methods

## Future Improvements

### Advanced Features
- **Explainability Integration**: Include feature importance tracking and SHAP values
