# Distributed Shared Memory Abstraction Layer

## Overview

### What it is and why it's important

Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) provides a programming model where processes on different physical machines can access shared memory locations as if they were local, abstracting away the complexities of network communication, consistency, and synchronization. This abstraction layer allows developers to write concurrent programs using familiar shared-memory semantics without dealing with explicit message passing.

### Real-world context and where it's used

DSM is fundamental in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, distributed databases, and cloud-native applications requiring low-latency shared state. For example, Apache Spark's RDD operations in-memory sharing across nodes uses DSM-like constructs, and distributed caching systems like Hazelcast or replicated databases often rely on DSM primitives for transparency and performance.

## Core Principles & Components

### Detailed explanation of all subcomponents, their roles, and interactions

1. **Memory Manager**: Handles local memory allocation and deallocation, maintaining mappings between virtual addresses and physical locations.

2. **Consistency Protocol**: Implements coherence policies (sequential, release, weak) to ensure memory consistency across nodes using techniques like directory-based protocols or broadcast invalidation.

3. **Fault Handler**: Manages node failures, replication, and recovery mechanisms to maintain data availability.

4. **Synchronization Manager**: Provides locks, barriers, and atomic operations across distributed nodes.

5. **Communication Layer**: Abstracts network transport, implementing efficient protocols like RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) or TCP-based memory updates.

### State transitions or flow

## Detailed Implementation Design

### A. Algorithm / Process Flow

The DSM implementation follows a page-based virtualization approach:

**Memory Read Operation:**
1. Local process attempts to access memory location
2. If page is local and valid → Direct access (hardware TLB hit)
3. If page is invalid/remote → Page fault trap
4. Trap handler identifies faulting address
5. Checks metadata: Is page owned locally? If yes, load from disk
6. If remote, initiate network fetch request
7. Block process until page arrives (or async via thread)
8. Update local page tables and TLB
9. Resume process execution

**Memory Write Operation:**
1. Local write to shared page
2. Mark page as dirty in metadata
3. For write-through consistency: Immediately propagate to all replicas
4. For write-back: Queue for batch propagation
5. Handle write-after-read conflicts using versioning

**Failure Recovery:**
1. Detect node failure via heartbeat mechanism
2. Identify orphaned pages using ownership directory
3. Replicate orphaned data to surviving nodes
4. Update consistency metadata
5. Notify dependent processes

```java
public class DistributedSharedMemory {
    private final Map<Long, PageMetadata> pageTable;
    private final NetworkTransport transport;
    private final ConsistencyManager consistencyMgr;
    private final PageReplacementPolicy replacementPolicy;

    public DistributedSharedMemory(NetworkTransport transport,
                                 ConsistencyModel model) {
        this.pageTable = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        this.transport = transport;
        this.consistencyMgr = new ConsistencyManager(model);
        this.replacementPolicy = new LRUPageReplacement();
    }

    @Override
    protected byte[] handlePageFault(long virtualAddress) {
        // Trap handler for page faults
        long pageId = virtualAddress >> PAGE_SHIFT;

        PageMetadata metadata = pageTable.computeIfAbsent(pageId,
            k -> new PageMetadata(k, PageState.INVALID));

        if (metadata.getOwner() == localNodeId) {
            // Local page, load from backing store
            return loadPageFromDisk(pageId);
        } else {
            // Remote page, initiate network fetch
            PageRequest req = new PageRequest(pageId, localNodeId);
            PageResponse resp = transport.sendSynchronous(req,
                metadata.getOwner());

            // Validate response and update local cache
            validateResponse(resp);
            pageTable.put(pageId, resp.getUpdatedMetadata());

            return resp.getData();
        }
    }

    private byte[] loadPageFromDisk(long pageId) {
        // Implementation for disk I/O
        try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(
            Paths.get("dsm_store/" + pageId), StandardOpenOption.READ)) {

            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(PAGE_SIZE);
            channel.read(buffer);
            return buffer.array();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new DSMException("Failed to load page from disk", e);
        }
    }

    public void write(long address, byte[] data) {
        long pageId = address >> PAGE_SHIFT;

        // Acquire write lock
        pageTable.get(pageId).getWriteLock().lock();
        try {
            // Update local copy
            memoryManager.writeToPage(pageId, data);

            // Propagate based on consistency model
            consistencyMgr.handleWrite(pageId, data, localNodeId);

        } finally {
            pageTable.get(pageId).getWriteLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### B. Data Structures & Configuration Parameters

**Core Internal Data Structures:**
- `PageTable`: ConcurrentHashMap<Long, PageMetadata> - Maps virtual pages to metadata
- `DirectoryTable`: Maps pages to lists of nodes with copies
- `OwnershipTable`: Tracks which node owns write permissions
- `VersionVector`: Tracks causality and conflict detection

**Tunable Parameters:**
- `PAGE_SIZE`: Default 4KB, affects granularity and network overhead
- `MAX_FAULT_TIMEOUT`: 5000ms - Maximum wait for page fetch
- `REPLICATION_FACTOR`: 3 - Number of nodes to replicate pages
- `COMMIT_INTERVAL`: 100ms - Batching interval for write propagation
- `CACHE_EVICTION_SIZE`: 10MB - Local cache size before replacement

### C. Java Implementation Example

The complete Java implementation focuses on thread-safe operations with multiple consistency models.

### D. Complexity & Performance

| Operation    | Time Complexity | Expected Performance | Worst Case               |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Local Read   | O(1)            | <1μs                 | O(1) + TLB miss ~100ns** |
| Remote Read  | O(1) + Network  | 100μs-10ms           | Network partition ~30s   |
| Local Write  | O(1)            | <5μs                 | Memory allocation O(n)   |
| Remote Write | O(replicas)     | 1-100ms * replicas   | Network failure retry    |
| Page Fault   | O(1) + Network  | 50-500μs             | Disk I/O ~10ms           |

*Real-world scale estimation*: For a 1000-node cluster with 1GB/s network links, expected throughput is 10-100 million remote operations/second with ~0.1% page fault rate and <5ms average latency.

### E. Thread Safety & Concurrency

**Lock Granularity:**
- Fine-grained per-page locks using striped locking
- Read-write locks for multiple concurrent readers
- Atomic operations for metadata updates

**Multi-threaded Scenarios:**
- Multiple threads accessing different pages: Fully concurrent
- Contended access to same page: Serialized via per-page locks
- Page faults during concurrent access: Faulting thread blocks, others proceed

**Lock-free Strategies:**
- Compare-and-swap for version vectors
- Hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation
- Lock-free page table updates using AtomicReferenceArray

```java
// Lock-free page table update
public PageMetadata getOrCreatePage(long pageId) {
    AtomicReference<PageMetadata> ref = pageTable.computeIfAbsent(pageId,
        k -> new AtomicReference());

    PageMetadata existing = ref.get();
    if (existing != null && existing.getState() != PageState.INVALID) {
        return existing;
    }

    // Create new metadata atomically
    PageMetadata newMetadata = new PageMetadata(pageId,
        PageState.LOADING, localNodeId);

    while (!ref.compareAndSet(null, newMetadata)) {
        existing = ref.get();
        if (existing != null && existing.getState() != PageState.INVALID) {
            return existing; // Another thread created it
        }
    }

    // Load page data asynchronously
    loadPageAsync(pageId, ref);
    return newMetadata;
}
```

### F. Memory & Resource Management

**Heap/Stack Considerations:**
- Page caches reside in heap space: Size = PAGE_SIZE × CACHE_SIZE
- Stack requirements minimal: O(1) per operation
- Avoids stack overflow through bounded recursion in fault handling

**Garbage Collection:**
- Uses reference counting for page metadata
- Weak references for inactive page entries
- Explicit cleanup during node shutdown

**Resource Optimization:**
- Zero-copy memory mappings using mmap for local pages
- Compressed page transfer for memory-bandwidth optimization
- NUMA-aware page placement on multi-socket machines

### G. Advanced Optimizations

**False Sharing Prevention:**
- Page-level granularity prevents cache line false sharing
- Padding between frequently accessed metadata fields

**Prefetching:**
- Predict future page accesses using Markov chains
- Background replication of popular pages

**Variants:**
- **Release Consistency DSM**: Allows relaxed ordering for performance
- **Entry Consistency DSM**: Associates synchronization with data items
- **Scope Consistency**: Groups variables into consistency scopes

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Common boundary conditions

1. **Page Size Boundary Access**: Writing across page boundaries requires split operations
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: Local cache full triggers eviction before allocation
3. **Network Partition**: Temporary isolation handled via timeout and retry with exponential backoff
4. **Concurrent Node Failure**: Multiple simultaneous failures require leader election for ownership transfer

### Failure recovery logic or resilience strategies

**Node Failure Detection:**
```java
public class FailureDetector {
    private final Map<NodeId, HeartbeatEntry> heartbeatMap;

    public void heartbeat(NodeId source, long timestamp) {
        heartbeatMap.compute(source, (k, v) -> {
            if (v == null) {
                return new HeartbeatEntry(timestamp, 0);
            }
            v.setLastSeen(timestamp);
            v.setMissedBeats(0);
            return v;
        });
    }

    public Set<NodeId> detectFailures(long currentTime) {
        return heartbeatMap.entrySet().stream()
            .filter(entry -> currentTime - entry.getValue().getLastSeen()
                > FAILURE_TIMEOUT_MS)
            .map(Map.Entry::getKey)
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }
}
```

**Recovery Process:**
1. Identify failed nodes and orphaned pages
2. Select new owners based on load balancing
3. Transfer page ownership metadata
4. Replicate orphaned data to new nodes
5. Notify all nodes of ownership changes

## Configuration Trade-offs

### Performance vs accuracy/resource trade-offs

| Configuration | High Performance | High Accuracy | Balanced       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Page Size     | Large (1MB)      | Small (4KB)   | Medium (64KB)  |
| Consistency   | Weak/Release     | Sequential    | Release        |
| Replication   | 2-factor         | 3-factor      | 2-factor       |
| Timeout       | Short (50ms)     | Long (5000ms) | Medium (500ms) |

### Simplicity vs configurability

Simple configuration uses defaults optimized for most workloads, while advanced configuration exposes 20+ parameters for fine-tuning data locality, network topology, and failure recovery behavior.

### Real-world tuning considerations

Production systems like Redis Cluster or HBase regions adjust DSM parameters based on:
- Network topology (same rack vs cross-rack)
- Workload patterns (read-heavy vs mixed)
- SLA requirements (latency vs consistency)

## Use Cases & Real-World Examples

### Where it's applied in production

1. **Database Sharding**: Vitess (YouTube's MySQL sharding system) uses DSM for cross-shard transactions
2. **Distributed Caching**: Apache Ignite provides in-memory data grid with DSM semantics
3. **High-Performance Computing**: Open MPI's shared memory windows for intra-node communication
4. **Cloud Storage**: Google Cloud Spanner uses DSM-like abstractions for globally distributed transactions

### Integration scenarios

- **Caching Integration**: DSM provides transparent persistence for cache-aside patterns
- **Message Queues**: Shared memory regions reduce serialization overhead in distributed messaging
- **Load Balancing**: DSM enables state sharing between load balancer instances

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Benefits

- **Programming Transparency**: Familiar shared-memory model reduces development complexity
- **Performance**: Avoids explicit serialization and network round trips
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through transparent distribution
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic replication and failure recovery

### Known trade-offs

- **Latency Sensitivity**: Network-dependent performance varies unpredictably
- **Consistency Complexity**: Weaker consistency models require careful race condition handling
- **Memory Overhead**: Replication and metadata increase memory requirements 3-5x
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Distributed state makes debugging race conditions challenging

### When not to use it (anti-patterns)

- Low-latency, high-throughput requirements (consider RDMA or Infiniband)
- High contention workloads (message passing scales better)
- Extremely large data sets (disk-based storage more appropriate)
- Real-time systems requiring guaranteed latency bounds

## Alternatives & Comparisons

### Compare with other similar patterns or algorithms

| Pattern     | DSM                              | MPI (Message Passing)       | Tuple Spaces         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Coupling    | Loose                            | Tight                       | Very Loose           |
| Performance | Variable (good for fine-grained) | Consistent (coarse-grained) | High (structureless) |
| Complexity  | High (consistency)               | Medium (coordination)       | Low (matching)       |
| Scalability | Good (automatic)                 | Excellent (explicit)        | Good (distributed)   |

### Why this approach might be preferred

DSM excels when porting existing shared-memory applications to distributed environments without code changes, providing better performance than message passing for fine-grained communication patterns.
