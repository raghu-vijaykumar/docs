# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

This document outlines the high-level design, key components, and scalability considerations for a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN is used to distribute content to end-users with high availability and performance. It does so by using a network of distributed servers to cache and deliver content closer to users.

## Step 1 - Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope

**Questions to Drive the Interview:**
- **C:** What type of content will the CDN handle (e.g., static files, dynamic content, video streaming)?
  - **I:** Primarily static files and video streaming.
- **C:** What is the expected scale in terms of the number of users and data volume?
  - **I:** 1 billion users with an estimated 50 TB of data per day.
- **C:** How often is the content updated?
  - **I:** Static content is updated weekly; video content is updated daily.
- **C:** What is the required latency for content delivery?
  - **I:** Less than 100 milliseconds.
- **C:** What are the security requirements?
  - **I:** Content should be delivered over HTTPS, with DDoS protection.

### Functional Requirements
- Deliver content quickly and efficiently to users across various geographical locations.
- Cache content at edge locations to reduce latency and load on origin servers.
- Ensure high availability and reliability of content delivery.
- Support for HTTPS and other security features.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Handle millions of requests per second and large data volumes.
- **Performance:** Minimize latency and ensure fast content delivery.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high uptime and fault tolerance.
- **Security:** Protect content and infrastructure from attacks.

## Step 2 - Propose High-Level Design and Get Buy-In

### High-Level Design

The CDN architecture typically consists of several key components:

- **Origin Servers:** These are the original servers where the content is stored. They serve as the source of truth for the CDN.
- **Edge Servers (Cache Nodes):** These servers are distributed globally and cache content close to users to reduce latency.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming requests to the nearest edge server.
- **Content Management System:** Manages content distribution and cache invalidation.
- **DNS System:** Directs user requests to the nearest edge server based on geographic location.


**CDN Workflow:**
1. **Request Routing:** A user makes a request for content. The DNS system resolves the request to the nearest edge server based on geographical location.
2. **Content Delivery:** The edge server checks if the content is available in the cache.
   - **Cache Hit:** If the content is cached, it is delivered to the user.
   - **Cache Miss:** If the content is not in the cache, the edge server retrieves it from the origin server, caches it, and then delivers it to the user.
3. **Cache Invalidation:** Cached content is periodically invalidated or updated based on cache policies or content changes.

## Step 3 - Design Deep Dive

### Scaling Considerations

**1. Edge Server Scalability:**
- **Geographical Distribution:** Deploy edge servers in multiple geographic locations to reduce latency and ensure global coverage.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling to handle varying traffic loads and ensure capacity is available during peak times.

**2. Caching Strategies:**
- **Cache Policies:** Define policies for caching and cache expiration. For example, use time-to-live (TTL) values to control how long content stays in the cache.
- **Content Purging:** Implement mechanisms for purging stale or outdated content from the cache.

**3. Load Balancing:**
- **DNS Load Balancing:** Use DNS-based load balancing to direct users to the nearest edge server.
- **Global Load Balancing:** Implement global load balancing to distribute traffic among edge servers across different regions.

### Fault Tolerance and Reliability

**1. Redundancy:**
- **Multiple Edge Servers:** Deploy multiple edge servers in each region to handle server failures.
- **Data Replication:** Replicate data across multiple origin servers to ensure content availability.

**2. Failover Mechanisms:**
- **Health Checks:** Implement health checks to monitor the status of edge servers and origin servers.
- **Automatic Failover:** Set up automatic failover to reroute traffic to healthy servers in case of failures.

### Security Considerations

**1. HTTPS:**
- **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt content and protect data in transit.
- **SSL Certificates:** Manage and deploy SSL certificates for secure communication.

**2. DDoS Protection:**
- **Traffic Filtering:** Implement traffic filtering and rate limiting to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- **Traffic Scrubbing:** Use traffic scrubbing services to clean malicious traffic.

**3. Access Controls:**
- **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms to restrict access to origin servers.
- **Authorization:** Control access to content based on user roles and permissions.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

**1. Performance Monitoring:**
- **Metrics:** Track key metrics such as request latency, cache hit ratio, and traffic volume.
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for performance issues, such as high latency or server failures.

**2. Log Management:**
- **Logging:** Implement logging to capture request and error details.
- **Analysis:** Use log analysis tools to monitor traffic patterns and detect anomalies.

**3. Regular Updates:**
- **Software Updates:** Regularly update CDN software and infrastructure components to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
- **Content Updates:** Update and manage content based on the defined cache policies.

## Conclusion

Designing a CDN involves creating a distributed network of edge servers to deliver content efficiently and reliably. Key considerations include scalability, fault tolerance, security, and monitoring. By leveraging a well-designed architecture and implementing best practices, a CDN can provide fast, secure, and reliable content delivery to users worldwide.
