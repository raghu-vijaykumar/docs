## Design Job Scheduling Batch Processing System

### Problem Statement
Design a scalable job scheduling and batch processing system that orchestrates distributed task execution, handles failures gracefully, and provides monitoring and analytics. The system must support complex job dependencies, resource allocation, and high-throughput processing of diverse workloads from ETL pipelines to machine learning training.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Schedule jobs with various triggers (cron, event-driven, API)
- Handle job dependencies and workflows with DAG support
- Resource allocation and quota management
- Job queuing with priorities and fair scheduling
- Retry logic and dead letter queue handling
- Job execution monitoring and logging

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High throughput for job submissions and executions (10k jobs/min)
- Fault tolerance with automatic failover
- Guaranteed execution (at least once, exactly once semantics)
- Scalability to millions of concurrent jobs
- Operational visibility with comprehensive monitoring

### Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Scale assumptions**: 10M jobs/day, 50k concurrent running jobs, 99.9% on-time execution; diverse job types from seconds to days ^[Assumption: Based on enterprise workflow platforms and cloud schedulers.]
- **SLA**: 99.99% availability, p95 job start latency <5s, SLA compliance tracking
- **Job Types**: Mix of CPU-bound, I/O-bound, memory-intensive workloads requiring different resource profiles
- **Distributed**: Jobs run across thousands of worker nodes with network dependencies

### High-Level Design
The system uses a distributed architecture with control plane for scheduling and data plane for execution. Jobs are queued with priorities and assigned to worker pools based on resource requirements. Fault tolerance is achieved through leader election and state replication.

### Data Model
- **Jobs**: Document store with job definitions, schedules, dependencies, and execution history
- **Queues**: Priority queues (Redis) with job partitions and TTL for fairness
- **Workers**: Relational storage for worker node inventory, capacities, and health status
- **Execution Logs**: Time-series database for job runs, metrics, and failure analysis

### API Design
RESTful APIs and async WebSocket for monitoring:

- **POST /api/v1/jobs** - Submit job: `{"name": "etl_job", "schedule": "0 */12 * * *", "dependencies": ["job1"], "resources": {"cpu": 2, "memory": "4GB"}}` → `{"jobId": "job123"}`
- **GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/status** - Get job status with execution history
- **PUT /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/pause** - Pause/resume job execution
- **GET /api/v1/workers** - Get worker pool status and resource utilization
- **WebSocket /jobs/status** - Real-time job completion notifications
- **POST /api/v1/workflows** - Submit DAG workflow: `{"nodes": [...], "edges": [...], "schedules": {...}}` → workflow orchestration

^[APIs support OAuth authentication and role-based access control for job submission.]

### Detailed Design
- **Scheduling Engine**: Time-wheel algorithm for cron scheduling, dependency graphs for workflow orchestration
- **Queue Management**: Multi-level queues with priority inheritance, rate limiting per tenant, and fair queuing algorithms
- **Worker Management**: Resource-aware scheduling using bin-packing algorithms, health monitoring with heartbeats
- **Execution Environment**: Container orchestration (Kubernetes) for job isolation, with resource limits and network policies
- **Failure Handling**: Circuit breakers for healthy/failed worker detection, exponential backoff for retries
- **Persistence**: Distributed consensus (Raft) for scheduler state, WAL for job queue recovery
- **Event Streaming**: Change data capture for real-time status updates and alerting

### Scalability & Bottlenecks
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless schedulers scale with job load, worker pools autoscale based on queue depth
- **Partitioning**: Job queues sharded by tenant/org, geographic distribution for low-latency execution
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent scheduling considers resource affinity and cost optimization
- **Cache Strategy**: In-memory job state for active executions, persistent store for historical data
- **Bottlenecks**: Queue depth spikes during peak hours; mitigated by elastic scaling and queue partitioning

### Trade-offs & Alternatives
- **Centralized vs Distributed Scheduling**: Centralized simpler to reason about vs. distributed handles failures better
- **Push vs Pull Execution**: Push provides instant scheduling vs. pull allows workers to control load
- **At-Least-Once vs Exactly-Once**: Exactly-once more reliable but adds complexity vs. at-least-once simpler for most jobs
- **Container vs VM Orchestration**: Containers faster startup vs. VMs better isolation for long-running jobs

### Future Improvements
- AI-driven resource prediction and optimization
- Multi-cloud job execution with failover
- Real-time job migration across regions
- Advanced dependency management with microservices orchestration
- Cost-aware scheduling with spot instance utilization

### Interview Talking Points
1. Explain priority scheduling: Multi-level feedback queues ensure fairness while prioritizing critical jobs
2. Discuss dependency resolution: Topological sort for DAG dependencies prevents circular waits and deadlocks
3. Address at-least-once delivery: Idempotent job execution design allows safe retries without duplicates
4. Compare push-pull models: Push instant but may overwhelm vs. pull allows workers to control intake
5. Handle distributed state: Raft consensus ensures scheduler failover without job loss
6. Optimize resource allocation: Bin-packing algorithms maximize worker utilization while meeting constraints
7. Manage queue depth: Adaptive thresholds and auto-scaling prevent starvation and excessive delays
8. Implement monitoring: Distributed tracing and metrics collection enable bottleneck identification and optimization
