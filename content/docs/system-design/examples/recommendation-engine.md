## Design Recommendation Engine

### Problem Statement
Design a scalable recommendation engine that provides personalized product/content suggestions to users. The system must process vast amounts of user behavior data, train ML models efficiently, and serve recommendations in real-time while handling A/B testing and continuously learning from feedback.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Real-time and offline recommendation generation
- Support for multiple recommendation algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid)
- A/B testing framework for model evaluation
- User feedback integration and model updates
- Content/product catalog integration
- Personalization based on user context and behavior

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Sub-second latency for real-time recommendations (<100ms)
- High throughput for batch recommendations (millions/day)
- Scalable to billions of interactions and users
- High accuracy with A/B testing validation
- Fault tolerance with graceful degradation

### Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Scale assumptions**: 1B+ users, 10B daily interactions, 100M unique items; 1B recommendations served/day ^[Assumption: Scale comparable to major e-commerce and content platforms.]
- **SLA**: 99.9% availability, p95 latency <200ms, 95% recommendation relevance score
- **Data Volume**: 100TB+ user behavior logs, 10s TB feature stores, 1PB historical data
- **ML Ops**: Daily model training cycles, hourly feature updates, A/B experiments running continuously

### High-Level Design
The system implements a Lambda architecture combining real-time processing with batch analytics. Feature stores cache recent data for real-time inference while data lakes store historical data for model training. A/B testing ensures continuous optimization.

### Data Model
- **User Interactions**: Time-series event logs with user-item ratings, clicks, purchases, and context
- **Feature Store**: Low-latency feature cache with user/item embeddings and real-time derived features
- **Model Artifacts**: Versioned ML models and embeddings stored in distributed object storage
- **Experiment Data**: A/B test metadata and performance metrics in analytical database

### API Design
RESTful APIs with streaming support:

- **GET /api/v1/recommend/{userId}?context={"page":"home","category":"electronics"}** - Get personalized recommendations: Response with ranked items and explanations
- **POST /api/v1/feedback** - Record user feedback: `{"userId": "123", "itemId": "456", "action": "clicked", "context": {...}}` → impression tracking
- **GET /api/v1/experiments/{experimentId}/results** - Get A/B test results with statistical significance
- **POST /api/v1/models** - Deploy new model: `{"modelUrl": "s3://...", "feature_version": "v2.1", "experiment_group": "A"}` → model rollout
- **GET /api/v1/features/{userId}** - Retrieve user features for debugging and personalization analysis

^[APIs support JWT authentication and rate limiting per user.]

### Detailed Design
- **Feature Engineering**: Real-time feature computation from event streams, batch feature extraction for historical data
- **Model Training**: Distributed ML training (TensorFlow/Spark ML) with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- **Online Serving**: Low-latency prediction service with model versioning and gradual rollouts
- **A/B Testing**: Multi-armed bandit algorithms for experiment allocation and statistical significance testing
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous learning from user interactions to update models and feature importance
- **Cold Start Handling**: Content-based recommendations for new users/items using metadata and clustering
- **Cache Strategy**: Multi-layer caching for popular item embeddings and user features
- **Monitoring**: Real-time model performance tracking, drift detection, and automated retraining triggers

### Scalability & Bottlenecks
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless serving layers scale with traffic, batch training scales with data volume
- **Data Partitioning**: User features sharded by user ID, item features by item category for distributed access
- **Compute Optimization**: GPU clusters for training acceleration, CPU fleets for serving optimization
- **Latency Management**: Edge caching for popular recommendations, request batching for similar users
- **Bottlenecks**: Training job scaling during peak data ingestion; mitigated by priority queues and resource reservations

### Trade-offs & Alternatives
- **Real-time vs Batch**: Real-time personalization more engaging vs. batch training enables deeper learning
- **Collaborative vs Content-Based**: Collaborative scales with user interactions vs. content-based works for sparse data
- **Offline A/B vs Online Learning**: Offline A/B safer deployments vs. online learning more adaptive but riskier
- **Centralized vs Federated ML**: Centralized training higher accuracy vs. federated preserves user privacy

### Future Improvements
- Deep learning architectures with transformers and attention mechanisms
- Multi-modal recommendations incorporating images, text, and context
- Cross-domain personalization (shopping to entertainment)
- Real-time model updates with online learning
- Ethical AI with bias detection and fairness optimization

### Interview Talking Points
1. Explain feature store: Low-latency storage for real-time features enables sub-100ms recommendations
2. Discuss A/B testing: Multi-armed bandits ensure fair experiment allocation and statistical significance
3. Address cold start problem: Content-based filtering for new users, collaborative for new items
4. Compare collaborative filtering: User-based vs. item-based trade-offs in sparsity and computation
5. Handle scale: Distributed training with parameter servers, serving with horizontal scaling
6. Implement feedback loop: Continuous model updates from user interactions improve accuracy over time
7. Manage model drift: Automated monitoring and retraining triggers maintain recommendation quality
8. Optimize latency: Caching hierarchies and request batching balance personalization with performance
