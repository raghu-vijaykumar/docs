## Design Online Gaming Platform

### Problem Statement
Design a scalable online gaming platform that supports real-time multiplayer interactions for millions of concurrent users. The system must handle matchmaking, game state synchronization, leaderboard updates, and social features while maintaining low latency and providing a fair competitive environment across global regions.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Real-time multiplayer game sessions with state synchronization
- Intelligent matchmaking based on skill levels and preferences
- Game leaderboard and statistics tracking
- Social features (friends, chat, clans/guilds)
- Tournament and event management
- Anti-cheat and fair play enforcement

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Ultra-low latency (<50ms) for game state updates
- High concurrent user support (millions simultaneously)
- Consistent global experience across regions
- Fault tolerance for seamless gameplay continuity
- Scalability for viral game releases and events

### Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Scale assumptions**: 100M active players, 10M concurrent online, 1M active game sessions; peak traffic during major tournaments ^[Assumption: Scale comparable to major gaming platforms with global reach.]
- **SLA**: 99.95% availability, p99 game latency <100ms globally, consistent matchmaking within 30 seconds
- **Game Diversity**: Support multiple game types from fast-paced shooters to turn-based strategy games
- **Global Distribution**: Players worldwide requiring cross-region matchmaking and regional content delivery

### High-Level Design
The platform uses dedicated game servers with global distribution for low-latency gameplay. Matchmaking employs skill-based algorithms while social features run on shared backend services. Real-time state synchronization is handled through optimized networking protocols.

### Data Model
- **Player Profiles**: User accounts with game stats, preferences, and social connections
- **Game Sessions**: Real-time session state with participant lists and game progress
- **Matchmaking Queues**: Priority queues ordered by skill ratings and wait times
- **Leaderboards**: Time-series rankings with periodic snapshots for tournament cutoffs

### API Design
Real-time WebSocket and REST APIs:

- **POST /api/v1/matchmaking/join** - Join matchmaking queue: `{"game_mode": "ranked", "skill_rating": 1500, "region": "us-west"}` → `{"queue_id": "q123", "estimated_wait": 45}`
- **WebSocket /game/{sessionId}** - Game state synchronization: Send actions `{"type": "move", "x": 10, "y": 20}`; receive updates `{"players": [...], "events": [...]}`
- **GET /api/v1/leaderboard/global?game=csgo** - Get leaderboard: Paginated rankings with player stats
- **POST /api/v1/tournaments/create** - Create tournament: `{"name": "Summer Championship", "rules": {...}, "prizes": 50000}` → tournament orchestration
- **PUT /api/v1/players/{playerId}/stats** - Update player stats: Atomic increments for performance tracking

^[APIs use JWT tokens for authentication and include rate limiting for abuse prevention.]

### Detailed Design
- **Dedicated Game Servers**: Containerized servers per game session with auto-scaling based on player count
- **Matchmaking Engine**: Elo-based skill matching with geographic proximity for optimal latency
- **State Synchronization**: Delta encoding for efficient network updates, authoritative server model for cheat prevention
- **Anti-Cheat System**: Client-server validation with statistical anomaly detection and replay analysis
- **Social Features**: Persistent chat rooms, friend systems, and guild management with cross-game compatibility
- **Tournament Platform**: Bracket management, spectator mode, and automated prize distribution
- **Global Architecture**: Regional data centers with game server placement optimized for player distribution
- **CDN Integration**: Game asset delivery, patches, and dynamic content updates

### Scalability & Bottlenecks
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Game server fleets auto-scale with player demand, matchmaking distributes load across regions
- **Geographic Distribution**: DNS routing to nearest data centers, cross-region replication for global social features
- **Compute Optimization**: GPU acceleration for physics/simulation, optimized networking stacks for low-latency
- **Resource Management**: Server allocation algorithms maximizing hardware utilization while guaranteeing QoS
- **Bottlenecks**: Network latency in cross-region play; mitigated by regional matchmaking and predictive migration

### Trade-offs & Alternatives
- **Dedicated vs Cloud Servers**: Dedicated servers lower latency vs. cloud servers offer better elasticity
- **P2P vs Server Authoritative**: P2P enables larger player counts vs. server authoritative prevents cheating
- **Global vs Regional Matchmaking**: Global matching maximizes competition vs. regional reduces lag
- **Real-time vs Turn-based**: Real-time requires complex synchronization vs. turn-based simpler but less engaging

### Future Improvements
- Cross-platform play with unified accounts
- AI opponents for single-player matchmaking
- Esports infrastructure with professional broadcasting
- Metaverse integration with 3D social spaces
- Blockchain-based digital asset trading

### Interview Talking Points
1. Explain dedicated servers: Each game session isolated prevents interference vs. shared servers more efficient
2. Discuss matchmaking algorithm: Skill-based sorting in queues ensures fair competition vs. random matching faster but unfair
3. Address global distribution: Regional server placement minimizes latency vs. centralized servers simpler ops
4. Compare state sync methods: Delta encoding efficient for bandwidth vs. full state sync simpler but wasteful  
5. Handle concurrent users: Auto-scaling server fleets manage viral growth vs. fixed capacity risks outages
6. Implement anti-cheat: Server-side validation ensures fair play vs. client-only vulnerable to manipulation
7. Optimize for tournaments: Dedicated tournament servers provide stability vs. shared servers cost savings
8. Scale leaderboard updates: Batch processing for global stats vs. real-time for competitive immediacy
