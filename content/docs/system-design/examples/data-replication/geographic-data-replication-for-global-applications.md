# Geographic Data Replication for Global Applications

## Problem Statement
Design a robust data replication system that ensures low-latency data access and high availability for global applications. The system must handle data replication across multiple geographic regions while maintaining consistency, fault tolerance, and compliance with regional data regulations. Key challenges include network latencies between regions, handling conflicts from concurrent updates, and ensuring data durability across global failures.

## Requirements

### Functional
- **Data Replication**: Automatically replicate user data, application metadata, and transactional logs across multiple geographic regions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle write conflicts in multi-master replication scenarios
- **Data Consistency**: Support multiple consistency levels (strong, eventual) based on use case
- **Failover Handling**: Automatically switch to replica regions during primary region failures
- *Assumption: Support for different data types including unstructured data, relational data, and time-series data*

### Non-Functional
- **Latency**: Read requests served from nearest region (<5ms for hot data)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime across all regions with automated failover
- **Scalability**: Support for petabyte-scale data with automatic scaling
- **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's) data durability across geographic failures
- **Compliance**: Adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data sovereignty laws
- *Assumption: Process 100K writes/second during peak load*

## Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Global Scale**: Operations in minimum 3 geographic regions (US East, Europe West, Asia Pacific)
- **Replication Lag**: Maximize 30 seconds lag for eventual consistency during normal operations
- **Network Bandwidth**: 10Gbps+ inter-region connections available
- **Data Volume**: Start with 1PB initial dataset, growing 50% YoY
- **Client Distribution**: 40% US traffic, 30% Europe, 30% Asia-Pacific
- **Storage Costs**: Budget of $2/MB/month for global storage
- *Assumption: No single region failure lasts more than 4 hours*

## High-Level Design

The system uses a multi-region architecture with leader election and asynchronous replication to balance consistency, latency, and availability.

## Data Model
- **Primary Data Store**: Distributed key-value store (inspired by DynamoDB/Cassandra)
- **Replication Metadata**: Version vectors, conflict logs, and replication timestamps
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins (LWW) for simple conflicts, manual resolution for business-critical data
- **Partitioning**: Data partitioned by region-specific keys with consistent hashing
- *Assumption: User data includes profiles, preferences, and session state*

## API Design
```java
public class DataReplicationClient {
    // Write operation with conflict handling
    CompletableFuture<WriteResult> write(String key, Object value, ConsistencyLevel level);

    // Read operation from nearest region
    CompletableFuture<Object> read(String key, ConsistencyLevel level);

    // Fetch replication status
    ReplicationStatus getReplicationHealth();

    // Manual conflict resolution
    boolean resolveConflict(String key, Object resolvedValue);

    // Regional failover trigger
    void triggerFailover(String failedRegion);
}
```

## Detailed Design

### Core Components and Reasoning
1. **Replication Manager**: Uses asynchronous replication with WAL shipping. Chosen for low write latency and eventual consistency. Includes conflict detection using version vectors.

2. **Leader Election Service**: Utilizes Raft consensus for leader determination across regions. Ensures single writer per data partition to prevent conflicts.

3. **Conflict Resolution Engine**: Implements vector clocks for timestamp ordering. Escalates business rule violations to manual queues.

4. **Regional Load Balancer**: Routes client requests to nearest healthy region. Uses geo-DNS for initial routing and health checks for failover.

5. **Storage Layer**: Multi-region object store with cross-region replication. Uses erasure coding for durability and partial replication for cost optimization.

*Assumption: Database choice is a globally distributed NoSQL store like ScyllaDB or FoundationDB supporting multi-region deployments*

## Scalability & Bottlenecks

### Scalability Features
- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Data sharded by geo+user regions for even distribution
- **Auto-Scaling Groups**: Instances scale based on CPU/memory usage per region
- **Cross-Region Replication Pipelines**: Dedicated network links for replication traffic

### Potential Bottlenecks
- **Inter-Region Latency**: Can cause write amplification (factor of 3x with 3 regions)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Manual resolution bottleneck during high-write divergence
- **Storage Costs**: 3x replication increases costs by ~200%
- **Network Bandwidth**: Cross-regional replication bandwidth limits (typically 10-20Gbps per region)

*Assumption: Bottleneck resolution through compression (zstd) reduces bandwidth by 60%*

## Trade-offs & Alternatives

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Consistency vs Latency**: Strong consistency requires synchronous replication (200ms+ latency) vs eventual consistency (30ms latency)
- **Availability vs Cost**: Multi-region replication (3x cost) vs single-region with backups
- **Durability vs Complexity**: Erasure coding (99.999999999% durability) vs simple replication (99.9% durability)

### Alternative Solutions
- **Multi-Master Replication**: Alternative to leader-follower, allows writes to all regions but increases conflict complexity
- **Read Replicas Only**: Lower cost but limited availability if primary region fails
- **Edge Caching with CDN**: For static data, minimizes global replication needs

## Future Improvements
- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Support AWS/Azure/GCP with unified API
- **AI-Powered Conflict Resolution**: Machine learning to auto-resolve conflicts based on historical patterns
- **Zero-Trust Encryption**: End-to-end encryption with geo-fencing keys
- **Observability Enhancements**: Distributed tracing and AI-driven anomaly detection
- **Event-Driven Replication**: Switch from polling to event-based replication for <1s lag

## Interview Talking Points
- **Multi-region Deployment**: Requires careful orchestration to balance latency, consistency, and availability while managing costs
- **Conflict Resolution**: Vector clocks prevent anomalies but create complexity - expect discussions on CRDTs vs operational transforms
- **Data Sovereignty**: Regional replication enables compliance but complicates single source-of-truth architectures
- **Failover Automation**: Leader election prevents split-brain scenarios using Quorum-based consensus (similar to Paxos/Raft)
- **Performance Optimization**: Write amplification with multi-region can be 2-3x; requires careful capacity planning and monitoring
- **Scalability Patterns**: Geo-sharding with consistent hashing ensures even load distribution across high-latency network boundaries
- **Cost Management**: Multi-region increases storage costs by 200%+, necessitating caching and data lifecycle policies
- **Monitoring Challenges**: Need comprehensive observability across regions for replication lag, conflict rates, and health metrics
- **Evolution Strategy**: Start with single-region, add replication per regulation, scale to multi-master as application matures
- **Real-world Analogies**: Like Cassandra's or DynamoDB's multi-region behavior, but with custom conflict resolution for unique business needs
