# Design Patterns

Typically, in design pattern literature, regardless of which language of design patterns we are talking about, we split all the design patterns into several different categories. These categories are often called Gamma categorization, named after Erich Gamma, one of the authors of the original Gang of Four book that uses C++ and Smalltalk.

## Gamma Categorization

1. **Creational Patterns**
    - These patterns deal with the creation or construction of objects.
    - Object construction can be more complicated than simply invoking a constructor.
    - **Explicit Creation**: Directly calling the constructor with arguments to initialize an object.
    - **Implicit Creation**: Using mechanisms like dependency injection frameworks or reflection to create objects behind the scenes.
    - **Wholesale Creation**: A single statement or constructor call is sufficient to initialize the object.
    - **Piecewise Initialization**: Several steps or statements are needed to fully initialize an object.

2. **Structural Patterns**
    - Concerned with the structure of classes and their members.
    - Focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
    - Examples include wrappers that mimic the underlying interface they wrap.
    - Emphasize good API design, making interfaces convenient and usable for others.
    - Structural patterns often involve replicating or enhancing interfaces for better usability.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
    - Unlike creational and structural patterns, behavioral patterns don't follow a central theme.
    - They address different problems and solve them in unique ways using various object-oriented mechanisms.
    - There may be some overlap (e.g., Strategy and Template Method patterns), but each pattern generally solves a specific problem with its own approach.
    - Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction and responsibility of objects.

| [**Command**](./command/readme)                                 | Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.                                 | Helpful for implementing undo functionality or queuing operations.                                                           |
| [**Chain of Responsibility**](./chain-of-responsibility/readme) | Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler can either handle the request or pass it along the chain.                                 | Used for handling requests with multiple possible handlers, such as in middleware systems.                                   |
| [**Mediator**](./mediator/readme)                               | Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling between them.                                                | Useful in complex systems where components need to interact with each other without tight coupling.                          |
